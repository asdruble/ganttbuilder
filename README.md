# Gantt Builder

This repository contains a small web application for composing simple Gantt-style timelines. Open `index.html` in your browser to use it.

## Features
- Configure period labels, starting index and count
- Create, rename, recolor and remove categories
- Add activities and drag or resize their bars directly on the timeline
- Import or export timelines as JSON files for later editing

The interface is implemented with [React](https://react.dev/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) loaded from public CDNs. No build step is required.
